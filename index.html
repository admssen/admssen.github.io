		<h2 class="incomprehensible">A Guide to Incomprehensible</h2>
		<p>
		This project is dedicated to a literature genre known as cosmic horror.<br>
		It purpose is to aid a writer to build a truly lovecraftian world, and to come up with its story.</br>
		</p>
		<h4>What's a cosmic horror</h4>
		<p>
		Lovecraftian horror, also called cosmic horror or eldritch horror, 
		is a genre, often called a subgenre of horror, fantasy fiction and weird fiction that emphasizes 
		the horror of the unknowable and incomprehensible more than gore or other 
		elements of shock. It is named after American author <a href="basics/origins.html#top">H. P. Lovecraft (1890â€“1937)</a>.
		</p>
		<h4>The impact of the genre</h4>
		<p>
		When writing fiction, one may stumble upon the need of a perfect representation of power.
		Some would need to introduce a deity, or at least a powerful creature the reader is supposed to fear.
		The ting is, it should never be...<br>
		human.
		<br>
		Something that is beyond human emotions, and most likely beyond one's picture of the world.
		If you have ever read H. P. Lovecraft, you may have touched the feeling of the wild nightmare
		he tried to deliver. You may want to have a brief read about one who is known as the father of
		cosmic horror. For further reading, you may want to read the basic concepts founded by Lovecraft,
		or get familiar with its practical use for worlbuilding.<br>
		As one could guess, the creation of the first half of XIX century yet still lives on as
		one of the most attractive cultural reference, and furhermore, a source of imagination,
		which makes a genre we mean truly a wonder.<br>
		To provide one with a visible trace of H.P. Lovecraft in the art of worlbuilding and storytelling, we may get one familiar with more modern
		makings.

		<h4>Lovecraftian Horror in Games<h4>
			<h5>Bloodborne and Souls-likes</h5>
			<p>
			Hidetaka Miyazaki is known for putting direct references to H. P. Lovecraft into games made by him.
			Bloodborne could be considered a nod to Chtulhu mythos, as a direct inspiration for a worldbuild.
			The very essence of the game which seems grim and dark from the beginning, slowly
			pushes a player into a face something endless that could be called maddening.

		<h4>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</h4>
		<p>
		H.P. Lovecraft (born August 20, 1890, Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.—died March 15, 1937, Providence)
		was an American author of fantastic and macabre short novels and stories, one of the 20th-century
		masters of the Gothic tale of terror.<br>
		Lovecraft was interested in science from childhood, but lifelong poor health
		prevented him from attending college. He made his living as a ghostwriter and rewrite
		man and spent most of his life in seclusion and poverty. His fame as a writer increased
		after his death.<br>
		From 1923 on, most of Lovecraft’s short stories appeared in the magazine Weird Tales.
		His Cthulhu Mythos series of tales describe ordinary New Englanders’ encounters with horrific
		beings of extraterrestrial origin. In these short stories, Lovecraft’s intimate knowledge of
		New England’s geography and culture is blended with an elaborate original mythology. His other
		short stories deal with similarly terrifying phenomena in which horror and morbid fantasy acquire
		an unexpected verisimilitude. The Case of Charles Dexter Ward (1927; published posthumously 1941),
		At the Mountains of Madness (1931, published 1936), and The Shadow over Innsmouth (1931, published
		1936) are considered his best short novels. Lovecraft was a master of poetic language, and he
		attained unusually high literary standards in his particular fictional genre.

		<h4>Lovecaftian fiction</h4>
		<p>
		A large theme in cosmic horror is that forbidden knowledge leads to madness.
		To explore this theme, there’s often some kind of cult or secret society that’s in charge
		of the knowledge, and the main character is involved in helping it come to light, whether
		willingly or unwillingly. This trope can also be accompanied by artifacts that connect with
		a previously unknown deity. This knowledge usually uncovers some deeper truth about reality
		or the universe and taps into existential dread.<br>
		A great example of this is Lovecraft Country by Matt Ruff, in which The Order 
		f the Ancient Dawn (a fictionalized society) plays a large role in the lives of
		the main characters. There are also artifacts used in this novel to explore this trope.
